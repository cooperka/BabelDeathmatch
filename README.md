# Babel Deathmatch

A game of Deathmatch in every language! Serves as a sandbox for me to learn new languages while implementing a "real" system.

## Usage

Each individual directory will contain its own README with compile/run instructions.

## History

Deathmatch is the first game I ever wrote. I came up with it freshman year of high school for our final project in C++, complete with ASCII art at the end. Later I implemented it in mSL for LlamaBot. The game sat idle for several years, but now I've decided to use it as a method of learning new languages by implementing a game of Deathmatch as I learn.

## Architecture

This UML diagram is super rough, and will definitely change as I write the first implementation here.
